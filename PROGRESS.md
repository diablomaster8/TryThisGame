# PROGRESS.md

Read this with CLAUDE.md at the start of every session.

## Standing approval (Maor, 2026-10-12)

"When you finish, proceed straight through to the next development. I'm approving it. Keep
going until you hit the session limit." So after each milestone passes its done-when
checks, start the next one without waiting. Still plan each one briefly in the session
log before coding, still keep the per-milestone commits and checks.

## Current milestone: M4 Expedition and shop — COMPLETE (2026-10-12, tag `m4`)

**Done when:** a run is fun on a phone and its rewards reach the Grove. Rewards verified
in the browser (results screen → Shells, Essences and Critters in the inventory) and in
`tests/sim/expedition.test.ts`; the run logic is deterministic, a tap jumps and a hold
jumps higher, obstacles cost Shells and never end the run. The "fun on a phone" half
still needs Maor's thumb on the deployed build (see Next steps). 109 tests, lint, build
pass.

## M3 Life cycle — COMPLETE (2026-10-12, tag `m3`)

**Done when:** egg → adult → rebirth → adult keeps everything correctly, and Eternal
follows the rules exactly. Verified by `tests/sim/lifecycle.test.ts` (a full life at
×1000: name, 10 % of points, grades, affection and rebirth count kept, heart greeting;
departure leaves a memorial; Eternal only with 2+ rebirths, Normal type and alignment
> 0.8 / < −0.8 / within 0.1 of 0, and never otherwise; Eternals never age; offline end
of life waits with departures off, departs with it on, rebirths always happen) and in
the browser (forced end of life → fading cocoon → flower; loved adult → golden cocoon →
egg → hatch with a heart). 97 tests, lint, build pass.

Earlier the same day: M1 (tag `m1`) and M2 (tag `m2`), see the sections below.

## Art direction (Maor, 2026-10-12)

The Nubbins are Chao-faithful fan art (CLAUDE.md was updated). The full Chao catalogue
and where it lands:

| Forms                                                             | Count            | Milestone |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | --------- |
| Eggs: normal + shop colour variants                               | 1 + ~20          | M1 / M4   |
| Child: Neutral, Hero-leaning, Dark-leaning                        | 3                | M1 ✓      |
| Adult first evolution: Neutral/Hero/Dark × Normal/Swim/Fly/Run/Power | 15            | M2 ✓      |
| Adult second evolution: type-pair overlays                        | 60 (75 total)    | M2 ✓      |
| Chaos Chao: Light, Dark, Neutral (the Eternals)                   | 3                | M3 ✓      |
| Character Chao (Tails, Knuckles, Amy, NiGHTS…)                    | ~6 unlockables   | M5        |
| Shiny, jewel, two-tone colour variants                            | palette layers   | M4        |

The art is drawn in code from memory (`src/render/sprites/chao.ts`), never from copied
assets. Reference images dropped into the project would let the drawer be matched closer.
Check any sheet at `?sprites` (developer gallery).

## What works (M0 + M1)

- **Scaffold / pipeline / camera / controls** (M0): see git history. Camera now re-applies
  its pose every frame and follows the Keeper.
- **Sim core** (`src/sim/`, no DOM, no Three.js, ESLint-guarded):
  - `types.ts` plain-data world with the v2 future fields (`genes`, `skills`,
    `karateRecord`) empty by default.
  - `rng.ts` mulberry32, one serialisable state word, stored in the world.
  - `clock.ts` fixed 100 ms steps, time scale ×1–×1000, per-frame step cap with coarse
    overflow.
  - `world.ts` commands in, events out. Trees drop fruit, items fall, Keeper intents.
  - `needs.ts` hunger 20 min, energy 40 min, naps 3 min, happiness −100..100 with drift,
    affection 0..100; moods for the face and emote ball.
  - `stats.ts` grades E–S with multipliers, 99-level cap. `alignment.ts` ±0.01 nudges,
    bands at ±0.5, type-lean winner with the 15 % margin.
  - `lifecycle.ts` egg → child (60 min) → cocoon (30 s) → adult; evolution picks the form.
  - `behavior.ts` wander, find food, eat, nap, sit, greet, cry, swim, react, held,
    carried, thrown. Throws arc with gravity; landing hurts.
  - `keeper.ts` walk by tap target or input vector, intents (pet, pick up, feed, shake
    tree, collect) executed on arrival, carrying above the head.
  - `save.ts` v1 with an (empty) migration table, validation/defaulting, fingerprint.
  - `offline.ts` catch-up: fine steps under 3 min, 1-minute coarse steps beyond; modes
    indefinite/capped/off; Nubbins eat tree fruit while away; evolutions reported.
- **Sprites** (`src/render/sprites/`): index-buffer PixelCanvas, atlas builder,
  8-view angle table (5 drawn + 3 mirrored), Chao child with 8 clips + 3 stills in neutral
  / Sun / Moon palettes, adult recolours for all 15 first evolutions, 6 egg colours with
  wobble/crack frames, cocoon, Sun/Moon Keeper, fruit, flower, emote ball shapes.
  `SheetCache` keyed by style; `sheetFromImage` for hand-drawn sheets later.
- **Render**: Grove scene (grass, pond, hills, 2 trees, waterfall, bushes), SpriteView
  billboards with UV frames and ground shadows, WorldView with step interpolation.
- **Input**: tap ground to walk, tap Nubbin to select, tap fruit to collect, tap tree to
  shake, drag Nubbin to lift / throw, shake by reversals, WASD/arrows relative to the
  camera, space shakes a carried egg. Two-finger gestures still rotate/zoom.
- **UI**: top bar (logo, Shells, fruit, Settings), stats sheet (meters with icon+label,
  stats with grades, Pet / Pick up / Put down / Feed / Shake, rename), Settings (Aging
  while closed with validation, departures toggle disabled when mode is off, export /
  import / reset save), While you were away, debug panel (` or triple-tap logo), toasts,
  carry chip, catch-up overlay.
- **Game loop** (`src/game.ts`): autosave every 30 s and on hide/pagehide, catch-up on
  load and on tab show, storage failures only toast.
- **Growth (M2)**: `sim/critters.ts` with the 15 species (3 per type, each with its
  part slots), `giveCritter` / `giveEssence`, type lean; `lifecycle.ts` evolution with
  the permanent grade upgrade, Sun/Moon Grove unlocks and the second evolution an hour
  into adult life; `world.grove` + `setGrove`; swimming trains Swim lean slowly.
- **Sprites (M2)**: `layout.ts` (shared geometry + `ChaoShape`), `parts.ts` (parametric
  ears/tail/arms/back for every species at all five angles), type silhouettes (Swim
  head fins, Fly big wings, Run legs, Power wide body and hands), second-evolution
  lighter touches; sheet keys include type, second and parts.
- **UI (M2)**: Give section on the stats sheet (critters and essences from the
  inventory), Keeper switch (☀/☾) and Grove switcher in the top bar (shown once a Grove
  is unlocked), evolution celebration card, debug +critters / +essences.
- **Life cycle (M3)**: `lifecycle.ts` runs the end-of-life check at 5 h of adult life
  (`runEndOfLife`): rebirth cocoon → `rebirth()` (egg again, same name, 10 % points,
  grades + upgrades, affection, rebirths +1, heart greeting on hatch) or departure
  cocoon → `depart()` (removed, memorial flower at its spot). `eternalBandFor` applies
  the Eternal rules at evolution; Eternals skip aging. Offline: `awaitingKeeper` freezes
  the adult at the check when departures are off; live play re-runs the check on screen
  (a Nubbin loved in the meantime is reborn instead). `TYPE_LEAN.minToCount` (20) keeps
  incidental pond time from making Swim types.
- **Art/UI (M3)**: three cocoon looks (evolve / rebirth glow / depart fade), Chaos-form
  palettes with great wings for Eternal Sun / Moon / Neutral (+ a star emote), memorial
  flower sprites, toasts and away-screen lines for cocoons, rebirths, departures,
  Eternals and waiting Nubbins; the sheet shows ✦ Eternal and "Waiting for you".
- **Expedition (M4)**: `src/minigames/expedition/run.ts` is pure, seeded, fixed-step
  logic (scroll with a gentle speed ramp, variable-height jump, patterns of shells,
  obstacles with shell arcs, essences, critters in bubbles). `screen.ts` draws it on a
  low-res 2D canvas (height 270, width from the aspect, letterboxed) with parallax
  clouds, hills, a grassy ground row; the runner is the selected Nubbin's own side-view
  walk/flap frames. Tap or hold the canvas, or space/↑/W. Results screen → `addRewards`.
  The Grove keeps simulating underneath with rendering paused.
- **Shop (M4)**: `sim/shop.ts` (fruit, egg with a 15 % rare colour chance and the roster
  cap of 8, hat into the collection, ball toy with a cap of 3) and `ui/shop.ts`.
- **Toys (M4)**: `play` behavior: walk to the ball, bat it around, a little happiness.
- **Tests**: 109 Vitest cases (sim rules, growth, life cycle, expedition, shop, world
  determinism, save round-trip, offline modes incl. the 7-day < 3 s check, sprite math
  and parts).

## What's stubbed

- Hats are bought into `inventory.hats` but worn only in M5.
- Shiny/jewel/two-tone colour variants: the egg colours exist (6); body colour variants
  are M5 polish with the hats.
- Character Chao looks, roster screen, races, personality, sound, PWA: M5.

## Known bugs / open items

- The Keeper walks straight through the pond to reach a swimming Nubbin. Add a shoreline
  stop or let the Keeper wade visibly (M2 polish).
- The Claude desktop browser pane throttles `requestAnimationFrame` to 0–3 fps, so
  time-based checks there were driven by calling `grove.frame()` from the console. On a
  normal browser the loop runs at the display rate.
- Portrait phones get a 125 px-wide frame. Revisit once the Grove is busier.
- Non-integer CSS upscaling can give uneven pixel columns; the render-target fallback is
  still the documented option in `pipeline.ts`.

## Assumptions made (not stated in CLAUDE.md)

- Camera is orthographic; billboards tilt back by the pitch (see M0 notes).
- Dragging lifts the Nubbin under the pointer without the Keeper; the Keeper carries via
  the sheet's Pick up button. Both are "pick up"; the sheet route is the kid-friendly one.
- Feeding uses the fruit inventory (collected by tapping fruit on the ground). A hungry
  Nubbin also eats ground fruit on its own.
- Happiness drifts toward 0 by 0.5/min so moods fade. Starving costs 2/min.
- The adult form rule (band × winning type) already runs in M1 so catch-up can report
  evolutions; the grade upgrade and Grove unlocks join it in M2.
- `src/platform/storage.ts` is a small folder outside the CLAUDE.md tree for the
  localStorage wrapper; sim/ must not touch storage.
- TypeScript stays at 6.0.3 until typescript-eslint supports 6.1+.

## Toolchain notes (this machine, 2026-10-12)

- Git 2.55 at `C:\Program Files\Git\cmd`; Node 24.21.0 via fnm at
  `%APPDATA%\fnm\node-versions\v24.21.0\installation`. Both on the user PATH; the Claude
  shell needs `$env:Path` prefixed with them.
- GitHub pushes work non-interactively (Git Credential Manager has the token).
- `npm run dev` then `http://localhost:5173/` (game) or `/?sprites` (gallery). In dev the
  game is exposed as `window.grove` for console poking.

## Next steps

1. **M5 Races, personality, polish** (see CLAUDE.md): races (3 courses of sections
   checking Swim/Fly/Run/Power/Stamina, 3 tiers with 4–8 seeded rivals, cheer button,
   prizes, side view with lanes in depth, readable in portrait), personality locked at
   evolution and shaping idle behavior, the roster with naming and hats (wearing),
   PWA install, sound (muted until the first tap), reduced motion, a device test pass.
   Done when every acceptance check in CLAUDE.md passes.
2. Phone checks owed to Maor: the Expedition's feel on a real phone (tap/hold timing),
   and the M0 60 fps check with 8 Nubbins.
